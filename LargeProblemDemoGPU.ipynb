    "A few important notes:\n",
    "- Most memory and compute efficiencies can only be made possible for structured meshes so for the most part this is what you should be doing.\n",
    "- Multi-Grid solvers for large problems are only avaible for structured meshes.\n",
    "- Material models do not yet support automatic differentiation so you will have to define both forward and backwards methods for your solvers.\n",
    "- Currently only linear elasticity physics is provided but you can supply your own stiffness matrix functions for different cases.\n",

    "First let us take a look at the material model calsses. We provide two types of material models ```SingleMaterial``` and ```PenalizedMultiMaterial```. Both models apply a penalty exponent and compute the gradients for the solver. In both cases you can also define a penaly schedule function. By default the penalty supplied will be applied during optimization. Here we will gradually ramp up penalty from 1 (no penalty) to 3 in the first 50 steps of optimization. Note that the solver will not stop until the schedule penalty and material model penalty are the same. So even if convergence criteria is met during ramp up the solver will continue (This is good because we may quickly hit convergence criteria with low penalty). Now let us start with a single material case first."
